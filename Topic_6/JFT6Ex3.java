//Create another version of the Fishermanâ€™s permit program to comply with the following logic.
//A fisherman is only allowed to go on a fishing trip if he holds a fishing permit and is aged over 18.
//Create two variables, one to store the permit status (store the value, false) and another to store the age of the person (store the value, 19).
//Use a single if statement as part of the solution.
